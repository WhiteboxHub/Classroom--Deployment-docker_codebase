## 1. Introduction

Pushing Docker images to Docker Hub is a crucial step in distributing your containerized applications. Docker Hub serves as a central repository where you can store and share your Docker images, making them accessible to others and ensuring consistency across different environments.

## 2. Prerequisites

Before pushing an image to Docker Hub, ensure that you have the following:

- **Docker Installed**: Docker must be installed and running on your local machine.
- **Docker Hub Account**: You need a Docker Hub account. If you don't have one, you can sign up at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/).
- **Docker Image**: You should have a Docker image that you want to push to Docker Hub.

## 3. Logging In to Docker Hub

To push images to Docker Hub, you need to log in to your Docker Hub account from your local machine. Use the `docker login` command to authenticate.

**Example**:

```bash
docker login
```

## 3. Logging In to Docker Hub

To push images to Docker Hub, you need to log in to your Docker Hub account from your local machine. Use the `docker login` command to authenticate.

**Example**:

```bash
docker login
```


This command prompts you to enter your Docker Hub username and password. Once authenticated, you can push images to your Docker Hub repositories.

## Tagging Your Docker Image

Before pushing an image to Docker Hub, you need to tag it with your Docker Hub username and the desired repository and tag names. Tagging ensures that the image is correctly identified and stored in the appropriate repository.

## Example

```
docker tag local-image\:tagname new-repo\:tagname
```
