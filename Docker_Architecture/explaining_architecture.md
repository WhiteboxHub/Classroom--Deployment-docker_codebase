# Docker Architecture

Docker architecture consists of several components that work together to facilitate containerization. Understanding these components is essential for effectively using Docker. This document outlines the key elements of Docker architecture: Docker Client, Docker Host, Docker Daemon, and Docker Registry.

## Components of Docker Architecture

### 1. Docker Client
- **Definition**: The Docker Client is the primary user interface for interacting with Docker.
- **Usage**:
  - Users communicate with the Docker Daemon through the Docker Client using command-line interface (CLI) commands.
  - Common commands include `docker run`, `docker build`, `docker pull`, and `docker push`.
- **Functionality**:
  - The client can run on the same machine as the daemon or connect to a remote Docker daemon.

### 2. Docker Host
- **Definition**: The Docker Host is the machine (physical or virtual) that runs the Docker daemon (dockerd).
- **Usage**:
  - The Docker Host is responsible for running containers and managing the associated resources.
- **Functionality**:
  - The host includes the Docker daemon, container images, containers, and the underlying operating system.

### 3. Docker Daemon (dockerd)
- **Definition**: The Docker Daemon is a server-side program that manages Docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Listens for API requests from the Docker Client.
  - Manages container lifecycle: creation, execution, and termination.
  - Handles communication with Docker Registries to fetch and store images.
- **Functionality**:
  - The daemon operates as a background process, continuously running to facilitate operations requested by the client.

### 4. Docker Registry
- **Definition**: A Docker Registry is a repository for storing and sharing Docker images. Docker Hub is the default public registry.
- **Usage**:
  - Users can pull images from a registry to their Docker host or push images to a registry after building them.
- **Types of Registries**:
  - **Public Registry**: Accessible to everyone (e.g., Docker Hub).
  - **Private Registry**: Accessible only to specific users or organizations, often used for proprietary images.

The Docker architecture can be visualized as follows:
