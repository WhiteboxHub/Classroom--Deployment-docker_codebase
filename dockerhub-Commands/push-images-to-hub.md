# Pushing Images to Docker Hub

## Introduction

Pushing Docker images to Docker Hub allows you to share your images with others and use them in different environments. This guide will walk you through the steps to push an image to Docker Hub.

## Steps to Push an Image to Docker Hub

### 1. Login to Docker Hub

Before you can push an image to Docker Hub, you need to login to your Docker Hub account. Use the following command to login:

```bash
docker login
```

This will prompt you to enter your Docker Hub username and password. Once you have logged in, you will be able to push your images to Docker Hub.

### 2. Tag the Image

Before you can push an image to Docker Hub, you need to tag it with your Docker Hub username and repository name. Use the following command to tag an image:

```bash
docker tag <image_name>:<tag> <docker_hub_username>/<repository_name>:<tag>
```

This command will tag the image with your Docker Hub username and repository name. For example, if your Docker Hub username is `john_doe` and your repository name is `my_repository`, you would tag the image with the following command:

```bash
docker tag my_image:latest john_doe/my_repository:latest
```

### 3. Push the Image

Once you have tagged the image, you can push it to Docker Hub using the following command:

```bash
docker push <docker_hub_username>/<repository_name>:<tag>
```

This command will push the image to Docker Hub. For example, if your Docker Hub username is `john_doe` and your repository name is `my_repository`, you would push the image with the following command:

```bash
docker push john_doe/my_repository:latest
```

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can push an image to Docker Hub and share it with others.
