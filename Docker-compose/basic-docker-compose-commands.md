# Basic Docker Compose Commands

## Introduction

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Docker Compose, you can use a YAML file to configure your application's services, networks, and volumes, and then use a single command to create and start all the services from your configuration.

## Common Docker Compose Commands

### 1. `docker-compose up`

This command builds, (re)creates, starts, and attaches to containers for a service defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

```bash
docker-compose up
```

### 2. `docker-compose down`

This command stops and removes containers, networks, and volumes created by `docker-compose up`.

```bash
docker-compose down
```

### 3. `docker-compose ps`

This command lists all the containers running for a service defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

### 4. `docker-compose logs`

This command displays the logs for a service defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

```bash
docker-compose logs
```

### 5. `docker-compose build`

This command builds an image for a service defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

```bash
docker-compose build
```

### 6. `docker-compose pull`

This command pulls the latest version of an image for a service defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

```bash
docker-compose pull
```

### 7. `docker-compose push`

This command pushes an image to a Docker Hub repository.

```bash
docker-compose push
```

### 8. `docker-compose restart` 

This command restarts a service defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

```bash
docker-compose restart
``` 

### 9. `docker-compose start`

This command starts a service defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

```bash
docker-compose start
```

### 10. `docker-compose stop`

This command stops a service defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

```bash
docker-compose stop
```

### 11. `docker-compose kill`

This command forcefully stops a service defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

```bash
docker-compose kill
```

### 12. `docker-compose rm`

This command removes a service defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

```bash
docker-compose rm
```

### 13. `docker-compose exec`

This command executes a command in a running container for a service defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

```bash
docker-compose exec
```

### 14. `docker-compose down`   

This command stops and removes containers, networks, and volumes created by `docker-compose up`.

```bash
docker-compose down
```
