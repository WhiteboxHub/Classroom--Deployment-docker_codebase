## 1. Introduction

Executing commands within running Docker containers allows you to interact with the container's environment, run diagnostic tools, and manage the application running inside the container. This is crucial for troubleshooting and maintaining your containerized applications.

## 2. Executing Commands in a Running Container

### Using `docker exec`

The `docker exec` command allows you to run commands inside a running container. The basic syntax is:

```bash
docker exec <container_id> <command>
```

### Example

```bash
   docker exec my_container ls /app
```

This command lists the contents of the /app directory inside the container named my_container

### Interactive Mode

To run a command in interactive mode, use the -it flags. This is useful for starting a shell session inside the container

```bash
   docker exec -it my_container /bin/bash
```

This command starts an interactive Bash shell session inside the container named my_container. You can execute commands as if you were logged into a regular system

### Detached Mode

To run a command in detached mode, use the -d flag. This allows the command to run in the background.

### Example

This command runs my_background_script.sh in the background inside the container named my_container


### 3. Copying Files to and from a Container

### Copying Files to a Container

To copy files from the host to a running container, use the docker cp command

```bash
   docker cp my_file.txt my_container:/app/my_file.txt
```

This command copies my_file.txt from the host to the /app directory inside the container named my_container
